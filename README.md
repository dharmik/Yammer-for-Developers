Yammer for Developers (y4d)
===========================

y4d is [Google Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/) that runs in [Yammer](https://yammer.com/).  
y4d is the code formater and highlighter in Yammer's messages.

We cannot use source codes readable in Yammer's messages (at 2012/11/06).  
So, y4d works to format and highlight in there!  
Because of that, y4j use a notation like GitHub.
